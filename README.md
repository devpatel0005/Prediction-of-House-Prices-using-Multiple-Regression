# 🏡 Prediction of House Prices using Multiple Regression
This project presents a predictive model for estimating house prices using Multiple Linear Regression, a fundamental statistical technique used in supervised machine learning. The model is trained and tested on a dataset that includes various features influencing housing prices, offering insights into the most impactful predictors.

# 📌 Project Overview
Objective: Predict the price of a house based on multiple independent variables (features).

Algorithm Used: Multiple Linear Regression

Tools & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Type: Supervised Regression.

# 🧠 Key Concepts Covered
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data preprocessing & feature selection

Model training and evaluation

Metrics: R² Score, MAE, MSE, RMSE

Residual Analysis and model validation

# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
The notebook includes:

Statistical summaries

Correlation heatmaps

Distribution plots

Feature vs. Price scatter plots

Outlier detection using boxplots

# 🧪 Model Training & Evaluation
Train/Test Split: 80% training, 20% testing

Model: Scikit-learn's LinearRegression()

Evaluation Metrics:

R² Score

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
